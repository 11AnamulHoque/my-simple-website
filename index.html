        <h3>My first website</h3>
        <p>The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink.  
        A gentle breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of fresh blossoms.  
        The city streets buzzed with energy as people hurried to their destinations.  
        Lost in thought, she traced patterns in the sand, letting the waves wash over her feet.  
        With a deep breath, he stepped onto the stage, ready to embrace the moment.</p>
